### Hello! I’m Darryl Norris. 👋
My name is Darryl Norris Marquez. In most places online, you can find as itsdarrylnorris. I am a software engineer currently working [@ShopPad](https://twitter.com/shoppad), previously [@HPE](https://twitter.com/hpe). I like to build websites and web applications in PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Golang. I have an unhealthy obsession with Mexican food (🌯) and mechanical keyboards (⌨️).
