Hey there, I'm Darryl Norris Marquez, but you can find me online as itsdarrylnorris. I'm a software engineer, currently working at [@ShopPad](https://twitter.com/shoppad) (previously at [@HPE](https://twitter.com/hpe)).

Aside from my love of tech, I'm also obsessed with Mexican food (🌯). In my free time, you can usually find me editing pictures and videos, or tinkering with some AI projects that have piqued my interest.
