### Hello! I’m Darryl Norris. 👋
My name is Darryl Norris Marquez. In most places online, you can find as itsdarrylnorris. I am a software engineer currently working @ShopPad, previously @HPE. I like to build websites and web applications in PHP, JavaScript, and Golang. I have an unhealthy obsession with Mexican food (🌯) and mechanical keyboards (⌨️).

🎭 Currently working webscraping tools 🕸️
